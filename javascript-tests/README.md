JavaScript Tests

This folder contains a series of tests and experiments to understand and explore JavaScript concepts, with a focus on ES6+ features and object-oriented programming.

## Contents

Hereâ€™s an overview of the concepts and tests in this folder:

1. **Classes and Objects**
    - Creating classes and their constructors.
    - Using methods, getters, and setters.
    - Understanding encapsulation with private fields.
2. **Inheritance and Polymorphism**
    - implementing inheritance with `extends` and `super()`.
    - Overriding parent methods in child classes.
3. **Static Methods and Properties**
    - Using static methods for utility functions.
    - Understanding the difference between instance and static properties.
4. **Advanced Topics**
    - Abstract class patterns using base classes.
    - Prototypes vs instance methods.
    - Memory management in classes.
5. **Mini-Projects**
    - Stack implementation.
    - Event emitter class.
    - Basic custom iterable example.

## Purpose
The purpose of this folder is to:
    - Test and solidify my understanding of JavaScript classes and modern features.
    - Build a foundation for larger web and backend projects.
    - Experiment with real-world programming patterns and scenarios.
