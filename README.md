# Tests Repository

This repository is dedicated to learning, experimentation, and testing programming concepts across various languages and technologies. It serves as a log of my progress and understanding of foundational and advanced concepts.

## Structure

The repository is organized into subfolders, each focusing on a specific language or topic. Below is a list of the current subfolders:

- **javascript-tests**: A collection of tests and experiments with JavaScript, including ES6+ features, classes, inheritance, and other modern concepts.

More subfolders will be added as I explore additional languages and topics.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:
- Document my learning journey.
- Serve as a reference for foundational and advanced programming concepts.
- Demonstrate my coding progress and proficiency to potential collaborators or employers.
